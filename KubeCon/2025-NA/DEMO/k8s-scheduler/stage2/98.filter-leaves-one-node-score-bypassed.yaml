# Comprehensive Test: Stage 2 Filter Makes Stage 3 Score Meaningless
# ============================================================
# This demonstrates how Stage 2 (Filter) constraints can make
# Stage 3 (Score) preferences irrelevant by reducing candidates to one node.
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Stage 2 Filter narrows down to only w5-k8s
# - Stage 3 Score preferences (zone-a, HDD) don't match w5-k8s
# - But w5-k8s is the only option, so Pod gets scheduled there anyway
# - Stage 3 preferences are effectively bypassed/meaningless

# ============================================================
# Expected Result:
# ============================================================
# Node: w5-k8s (zone-c, SSD, GPU taint)
#
# Why Stage 3 is meaningless:
# 1. Stage 2 Filter left only w5-k8s as a candidate
# 2. Stage 3 Score preferences wanted zone-a + HDD
# 3. But w5-k8s is zone-c + SSD (opposite of preferences!)
# 4. However, w5-k8s is the ONLY option, so it gets scheduled there
# 5. Stage 3 preferences had ZERO impact on the decision
