# ============================================================
# Stage 1 Test: nodeName bypasses scheduler taint checks (Success)
# ============================================================
# Demonstrates that nodeName bypasses ALL scheduler checks including taints
# w1-k8s has gpu:nvidia=NoSchedule taint
# Without nodeName, this Pod would fail scheduling (no toleration)
# With nodeName, Pod is placed directly on w1-k8s (bypasses scheduler)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

  nodeName: w1-k8s  # Direct placement on tainted node

  # No tolerations - but nodeName bypasses taint check
  # Result: Pod runs successfully on w1-k8s despite NoSchedule taint
