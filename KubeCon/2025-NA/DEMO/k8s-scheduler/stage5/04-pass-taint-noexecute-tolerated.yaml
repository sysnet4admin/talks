# Stage 5: Kubelet Admission - NoExecute taint validation
# ============================================================
# Stage 5 Test: NoExecute taint is checked by kubelet

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: stage5-pass-noexecute-taint
  labels:
    test: stage5-kubelet-admission
    component: taint-noexecute
spec:
  nodeName: w6-k8s  # w6-k8s has maintenance=true:NoExecute taint
  tolerations:
  - key: maintenance
    operator: Equal
    value: "true"
    effect: NoExecute  # Kubelet validates NoExecute taints

# Expected Result:
# Status: Running
# Node: w6-k8s
#
# Note: Unlike NoSchedule taints (which kubelet ignores when nodeName is set),
# NoExecute taints are always validated by kubelet for admission and eviction
