# Stage 5: Kubelet Admission (Node-level validation)
# ============================================================
# Stage 5 Test: nodeAffinity validation by kubelet
# Even with nodeName set, kubelet validates nodeAffinity

# Expected Result:
# Status: NodeAffinity (Failed)
# Message: "Predicate NodeAffinity failed: node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector"
# From: kubelet
#
# This demonstrates that kubelet performs node affinity validation
# even when the scheduler is bypassed via nodeName
