# ============================================================
# Stage 5 Test: nodeSelector validation by kubelet

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: stage5-fail-nodeselector
  labels:
    test: stage5-kubelet-admission
    component: nodeselector
spec:
  nodeName: w2-k8s  # w2-k8s has disktype=hdd
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd  # w2-k8s has hdd, not ssd - kubelet will REJECT
  containers:

# Expected Result:
# Status: NodeAffinity (Failed)
# Message: "Pod was rejected: node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector"
# From: kubelet
#
# Note: nodeSelector failures also show as "NodeAffinity" status
# because nodeSelector is internally converted to nodeAffinity
